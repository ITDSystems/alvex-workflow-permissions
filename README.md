# Alvex workflow shortcut dashlet

Features:
* Dashlet on user and site dashboard to start workflows in one-click.
* Permissions for groups and orgchart roles to limit access to some business process types. Sample use case: document registration workflow can be available for secretaries only and budget approval workflow only for managers. Permissions are set by administrator and enforced through the whole system.
